# Overhaul

The initial commit into the master has the login screen already built for the application.

The main files you will be focused on are the...

AndroidManifest.xml -> deals with application specific permissions like location, camera, or bluetooth, etc.
Java folder -> the code to handle the logic and functionality of the xml files
res -> layout -> Deals with the look and feel of the application
